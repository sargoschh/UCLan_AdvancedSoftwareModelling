@article{Hamie2006,
	abstract = {The Object Constraint Language (OCL) is a formal specification language that could be used for constraining the modelling elements that occur in UML diagrams. The Java Modeling Language (JML) is a behavioural interface specification language designed for specifying Java classes and interfaces. This paper investigates the mapping of OCL constraints to JML constraints together with its properties. In particular the paper shows how those constructs such as iterators that are not directly supported by JML are transformed to an equivalent form that can be mapped directly to JML. The paper proposes a special library for OCL types implemented in Java that facilitates the mapping. Extracts from a case study will be used to illustrate the mapping. © 2006 IEEE.},

@article{Algarni2018,
	abstract = {Code generation tools are known to be highly effective for developing an object-oriented system, as these systems require developers to design the system early in the development. With the increased adoption of Agile methods for developing and managing software processes, many software industries have been using tools such as Jira and Agilean for project planning, monitoring, release management, retrospective analysis, and activity evaluation. The advantages of utilizing these tools are building a channel for communication, organizing and prioritizing work, visibility, flexibility, and transparency. However, these tools don't provide guidance in early stages of development. This paper introduces a tool that injects a new developer-centric artifact called developer story. Developer stories are short, structural descriptions of a system blueprint. The tool directs Agile developers in creating the detailed design of a system early in the development stage, after which it generates the source code supporting the Design by Contract approach. The essence of a developer-centric tool is to focus on what the developer needs to implement. We evaluate the tool by developing a small-scale application and demonstrating how the Design by Contract approach is applied.},

@article{Tang2024,
	abstract = {The exploitation and hijacking of API vulnerabilities are becoming increasingly prominent issues in software supply chain security. This paper proposes an Object-Z based formal verification method for APIs in the supply chain, aiming to address the security risks associated with API applications. By incorporating the concept of design by contract and using Object-Z for formal modeling, a dynamic defense against API threats is implemented. Finally, based on a classification analysis of API threats in the supply chain, this paper presents a ase study through modeling and application analysis.},

@article{Brizhinev2018,
	abstract = {We describe a successful attempt to formally verify a simple genetic algorithm written in Java. To this end, we compare several formal verification tools designed for Java, and select Krakatoa as the most appropriate for the task. Based on our experience, we present several suggestions for making the tools more user friendly, which we hope will lead to wider adoption of formal methods. In particular, we discuss at length how useful it would be for provers to perform some form of abduction, that is, for them to guess which extra assumptions they need to prove a statement. It is our opinion that progress in this area would produce the largest improvement in the usability of formal verification tools.},
